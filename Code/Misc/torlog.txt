As a privacy-conscious Tor operator, enabling logs requires careful consideration due to legal and ethical implications. I strongly recommend consulting the Tor community (tor-relays mailing list or #tor-relays on OFTC IRC) before implementing any logging. If you still decide to proceed after understanding the risks:
Minimal Logging Configuration (Privacy-Focused)

Add these lines to your torrc file (usually /etc/tor/torrc):
ini

# Log ONLY exit connections (destination IP:port) with timestamps
Log notice file /var/log/tor/notices.log
ExitLog notice /var/log/tor/exit.log

# Explicitly DISABLE risky logs
AvoidDiskWrites 1
DisableDebuggerAttachment 0

Key Steps:

    Create log directory (run as root):
    bash

mkdir -p /var/log/tor
chown debian-tor:debian-tor /var/log/tor  # Replace user/group if needed
chmod 700 /var/log/tor

Reload Tor:
bash

sudo systemctl reload tor  # Systemd
# OR
sudo killall -HUP tor      # SysVinit

Verify logs:
bash

    tail -f /var/log/tor/exit.log

    Sample output:
    [notice] [exit] Opened exit connection to 203.0.113.5:443 at 2025-07-13 12:34:56

Critical Privacy Safeguards

    Automatic log deletion (Add to /etc/logrotate.d/tor):
    conf

/var/log/tor/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 3
    compress
    missingok
    create 640 debian-tor debian-tor
    postrotate
        /bin/kill -HUP $(cat /var/run/tor/tor.pid 2> /dev/null) 2> /dev/null || true
    endscript
}

*Deletes logs after 3 days - adjust rotate value as needed*

NEVER log sensitive data - Avoid these in torrc:
ini

    # DANGEROUS EXAMPLES (DO NOT USE)
    Log debug
    Log info
    ProtocolWarnings 1
