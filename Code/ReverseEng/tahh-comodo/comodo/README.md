# Comodo alternate 'cmdscan' version

This directory contains the alternative command line scanner for the Comodo antivirus for Linux. Naturally, it requires to have installed Comodo Antivirus for Linux.

This alternative version allows scanning relative paths and shows much more information about the detected (or white-listed!) files like, for example, which internal scanner detected the malware sample, the calculated CRCs for appropriate signatures, etc...

This tool and how to write it is explained in great detail in Chapter 2 of "The Antivirus Hackers Handbook".
